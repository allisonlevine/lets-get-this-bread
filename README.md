To download this project, download via git or zip! (By clicking on the green "Code <>" button up top)


To get node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (download the installer for your system!)
You need node to run the npm (node package manager) scripts to run this code base.

You'll also want a code editor, though it's not necessary it makes live easier.
I use VSCode found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Getting started
For all of these commands run them in your command line, in the SAME folder as the package.json for this project.
To get to your command line, go to windows and type CMD, or just google it.

Clone the project and in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all the packages in `create react app` + Phaser 3

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
